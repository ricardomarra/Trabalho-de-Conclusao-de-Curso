# Trabalho-de-Conclusao-de-Curso

This repository was created to share and show the material used to write my final paper "Production of All-in-Focus Images Based on Depth Maps"

The material shared includes the codes, images and some of my results. 

The material is organized in four folders.

- dataset: contains all the input images.
- depthmaps: contains all the depth maps.
- functions: contains all the functions.
- myresults: the final results.

There are two main functions, TilePick_code and MaskPick_code.
To execute the code, simply run the main.
